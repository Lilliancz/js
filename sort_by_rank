People have a chance to build strong social networks, and they think of the workplace as fun and exciting. People remain in the organization at least partly because they feel that they are better for being an employee here.',

Employees feel passionately about the objectives being pursued, and they view the outcomes as more significant than just the organization&rsquo;s or the employees&rsquo; success. People have a sense of personal calling, not just a job. People remain in the organization at least partly because they feel genuine love and passion for the work they are pursuing.',
